# Software-Design-and-Implementation
This is the compilation of all of the coding work I completed in my introductory python coding course at Berea College. I took this course in the Spring of 2014. 

The work included in this respository spans from my original beginning as a programmer. Some projects were completed in teams of two following good pair programming practices.
